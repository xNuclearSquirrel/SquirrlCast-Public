# Connecting to the Goggles

## USB Connection and Permissions

1. Connect your phone to the DJI goggles using a **USB-C cable**.
2. When Android shows the USB permission prompt, tap **Allow** to let SquirrelCast access the goggles.

If you accidentally deny the permission, SquirrelCast cannot connect. Tap the in-app button to show the permission prompt again.

## Important: Close DJI Fly

**DJI Fly must be closed** while using SquirrelCast. The goggles can only connect to one app at a time.

If DJI Fly is set to open automatically:
1. Unplug the goggles.
2. Open **DJI Fly** and fully close it (remove it from recent apps).
3. Plug the goggles back in and return to SquirrelCast.

## Connection Status

These screens show the difference between:
- A successful connection to the goggles
- A connection where the goggles are actively receiving video from an aircraft/drone
