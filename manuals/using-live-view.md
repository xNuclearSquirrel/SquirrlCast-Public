Recording continues even if you:
- Switch out of the Player tab
- Minimize the app
- Lock your phone

You can also start or stop recording from the Android foreground notification. It shows the current recording state and the recording duration.

## Changing camera settings

Tap the **Settings** icon in the bottom right. This opens a menu where you can set the recording parameters of the air unit directly.

These include:
- ISO
- Shutter Speed
- Exposure Bias
- White Balance
- Resolution
- Aspect Ratio
- Framerate

Changing these will directly affect the camera settings of the drone or air unit.
