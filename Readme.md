# SquirrelCast App, Manuals, and Tools

SquirrelCast is an Android smartphone-based video-out solution for newer DJI goggles (anything compatible with **O3** and **O4**).

## What SquirrelCast Does

- Connect your phone to the goggles via a **USB-C cable**
- View **live video** inside the app
- Record video directly to your phone  
  - Optional: enable audio from your phone’s microphone (great for commentary)
- Change camera settings on the air unit or DJI drone directly from the app
- Stream live video over your local network to other devices:
  - Share to a web browser via **WebRTC**, no additional software needed
  - Share via **RTSP** to third-party apps such as **VLC**, and ground stations such as **ArduPilot Mission Planner**
- (DJI Goggles 3) Configure the goggles’ Wi-Fi and use **SquirrelReceiver** to stream directly from the goggles to a Windows PC over Wi-Fi, no app in between

## Get the App

- **Google Play:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NuclearSquirrel.SquirrelCast

>Note: The app is still in closed testing, but is expected to be released within a few days!
